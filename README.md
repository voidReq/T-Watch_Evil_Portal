# T-Watch_Evil_Portal
An evil portal application for the LILYGO T-Watch S3

I made this a long time ago, it may or may not work. You'll have to load the html files onto the device with LittleFS. Otherwise, relatively plug 'n play. Can customize HTMLs or AP name. Also, there's a bunch of IR stuff in there, because I used this to clone some projector remotes. Ignore all the IR stuff.
